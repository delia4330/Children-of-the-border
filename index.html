	<h1> Children Of The Border</h1>
	<p>Imagine you're 5 years old, you haven't eaten in weeks. Imagine that you and your mother have to go out everyday to work bringing little to almost no money back home. When you do have some money you have gangs that go around your neighborhood and ask for "thier dues". Your older sister is only 9 and shes already been sexually abused. Your father was killed by corruput police. Then your mother gets a phone call. It's her sister, she says she has a job secured to her in the U.S.A this job will be enough for your mother to get an apartment and for you and your sister to have a second chance. This isn't an imagination, this is childrens everyday live from honduras to el salvador its a reality they live everyday </p>
