<h1>The number of unaccompanied minor children are 76,000 
The U.S. government is required by law to pursue "prompt and continuous efforts" to unify unaccompanied migrant children with family. In practice, those efforts vary widely at roughly 170 facilities across the country, an analysis of government data being shared with members of Congress Monday has found.

Children at some standard facilities may be released to family in as little as a month. At others, it takes more than three months. 

Some children end up in "secure" facilities, more like the juvenile detention where U.S. teens accused of serious crimes are held. The children in these secure facilities are held on average more than six months.

What is the outcome of children being in these detention centers? These children usually have psychological trauma. It is even said many are kidnapped in the border and sex trafficked

This is a quote from a child who resides in one of these detention centers
It also includes quotes from children who wrote testimonials about their time in secure facilities.

"I sleep in a locked jail cell. The beds are thin mattresses on top of a block of cement and we don't get pillows. I have a make-shift pillow that I make out of my sweaters or other clothes," one child in a secure facility wrote, according to the report. "The guards also push us, pepper spray us, and place the handcuffs excessively tight to the point that wrist injuries frequently occur."</h1>
