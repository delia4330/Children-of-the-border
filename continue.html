	<title> Children Of The Border </title>
<h1>According to new data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, over 850,000 migrants were detained at the U.S.- Mexico border in fiscal 2019. The figure is more than double the previous year's total, and it includes a record number of unaccompanied migrant children--many more than previously understood.
Most of these families are coming from Central America, from three countries, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, largely fleeing economic instability and violence. So Just how many children are detained at these borders?</h1>
